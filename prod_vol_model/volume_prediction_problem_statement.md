### Problem Statement: Production Volume Prediction

#### Objective
Develop a machine learning model to predict the `Production Volume (units)` for foam factory operations using the dataset `FoamFactory_V2_27K.csv`.

#### Input Features
The model will use the following features from the dataset:
- `Factory`: Identifier for the factory.
- `Date`: Date of production.
- `Location`: Location of the factory.
- `Machine Type`: Type of machine used.
- `Machine Utilization (%)`: Percentage of machine utilization.
- `Machine Downtime (hours)`: Hours of machine downtime.
- `Maintenance History`: Maintenance history (e.g., regular or irregular).
- `Machine Age (years)`: Age of the machine.
- `Batch`: Identifier for the production batch.
- `Batch Quality (Pass %)`: Quality pass percentage of the batch.
- `Cycle Time (minutes)`: Time taken to complete a production cycle.
- `Energy Consumption (kWh)`: Energy consumed during production.
- `Energy Efficiency Rating`: Energy efficiency rating of the machine.
- `CO2 Emissions (kg)`: Carbon dioxide emissions during production.
- `Emission Limit Compliance`: Compliance with emission limits.
- `Waste Generated (kg)`: Waste generated during production.
- `Water Usage (liters)`: Water used during production.
- `Shift`: Shift during which production occurred.
- `Operator Experience (years)`: Experience of the operator.
- `Team Size`: Size of the production team.
- `Team Members`: Details of team members.
- `Operator Training Level`: Training level of the operator.
- `Absenteeism Rate (%)`: Absenteeism rate of the team.
- `Product Category`: Category of the product.
- `Supplier`: Supplier of raw materials.
- `Supplier Delays (days)`: Delays from the supplier.
- `Raw Material Quality`: Quality of raw materials.
- `Market Demand Index`: Market demand index for the product.
- `Cost of Downtime ($)`: Cost incurred due to downtime.
- `Revenue ($)`: Revenue generated.
- `Profit Margin (%)`: Profit margin.
- `Breakdowns (count)`: Number of machine breakdowns.
- `Safety Incidents (count)`: Number of safety incidents.
- `Defect Rate (%)`: Defect rate of the batch.
- `Temperature (C)`: Temperature during production.
- `Pressure (psi)`: Pressure during production.
- `Chemical Ratio`: Chemical ratio used in production.
- `Mixing Speed (RPM)`: Mixing speed during production.

#### Target Variable
- `Production Volume (units)`: Total units produced.

#### Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize/standardize features.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features if necessary and select relevant features.
3. **Model Selection**: Train and evaluate machine learning models (e.g., linear regression, random forest, gradient boosting).
4. **Model Evaluation**: Use metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² to evaluate model performance.
5. **Deployment**: Deploy the best-performing model for production volume prediction.
